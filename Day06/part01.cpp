// To solve this, store the sequence of read chars, until the desired length is reached.
// Before adding a new character, check if it is already present in the sequence.
// If the new character is already in the sequence, delete the first characters of the sequence until there are no more repetitions.
// To do this, just delete until the instance of the repeated character, inclusively.
//
// Example:
// Sequence: qwr
// New character: w
// Resulting sequence (with repetition): qwrw
// What happens: Remove the first two characters
// Resulting sequence (without repetition): rw
//
// This will repeat everytime there is a character repetion.
// When the sequence reaches the desired length, it will do so without any repeating characters.
